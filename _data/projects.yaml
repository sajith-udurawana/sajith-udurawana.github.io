    I took the lead in developing Xplora Mining, an internal productivity application tailored for a leading global silver mining firm headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. This sophisticated tool serves as a central hub for over 500 employees, facilitating the tracking of essential mining activities, ensuring adherence to health and safety standards, and managing financial aspects.
